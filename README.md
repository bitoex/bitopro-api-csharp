## Usage
Code examples below, or clone the repository and run the  project.

### Creating a Client
General usage just requires setting up the client with your credentials, and then calling the Client as necessary.
```c#
// Build out a client, provide a logger, and more configuration options, or even your own APIProcessor implementation
var bitopro = new BitoproRestApi(API_KEY, API_SECRET);

//You an also specify symbols like this.
var string SYMBOL = "BTC_USDT";
dynamic response;
response = await bitopro.GetCurrencies();
```

### Creating a WebSocket Client
For WebSocket endpoints, just instantiate the BitoproWebsocket.
You can use a `using` block or manual management.
```c#
// [PUBLIC] GET Order book
var bitoproWsOrderBook = new BitoproOrderBookWebsocket(symbolsLimit);
bitoproWsOrderBook.On_Receive_Message += Receive_WsMessage;
bitoproWsOrderBook.InitWebsocket();

static void Receive_WsMessage(string message)
{
    Utils.Logger.Info(message);
}
```
